    "## Waterfall model and historical context\n",
    "\n",
    "While today the idea of approaching software development sounds pretty standard that was not always the case. In the 90s and early 00s software development was largely seen as a sequential process. Work would be split up into distinct phases and one phase would have to be completed before the next phase could begin. When thinking visually, this approach where phases are moving forward one after another and never backwards, resembles as waterfall, where water only falls down and not up. Thus it was given the *waterfall* name."

    "Historically this was most likely because software engineering being a new field (relatively speaking) did not have standardized practices yet and had to borrow these practices from neighboring fields. Some of these neighboring fields were building construction and hardware manufacturing. When the building is being built, once a 2nd floor is finished, you can argue that it would be impractical to completely redo the 1st floor, thus it creates a need to plan in advance, because redos might be overly costly. Same applies to computer hardware, because hardware manufacturing is costly process, it might be too expensive to manufacture multiple chips just to find out that they are not behaving exactly as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However software development has one big difference from these other fields - it is (relatively) cheap to do it. Ignoring all the maintenance, technical debt and similar considerations, it is very easy to change some functionality and deploy it to make it available to all users. Because of this approaches like thinking of a solution to a problem, developing an iteration of solution, getting user feedback and adjusting the solution to the given feedback becomes viable in software engineering, but not necessarily in other fields."

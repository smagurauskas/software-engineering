If the tests were to run longer, for let's say 10 minutes, then it is almost guaranteed that engineers would run them very rarely, maybe once before the pull request.\n",

    "Test coverage percentage is not a very reliable metric for software quality. High coverage shows that the code runs during tests but doesnâ€™t prove that behavior is tested correctly. However, it is quick to implement and can be useful when combined with practices like code reviews."

On top of that they are not controllable by user, but are rather provided by the runtime. If the tests assumes that some date is always going to be future date and asserts it against some predefined date. Eventually the future will arrive and the date will become past date and the test will begin to fail. "

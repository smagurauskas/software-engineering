    "### Some tips for pull requests\n",
    "\n",
    "When reviewing a pull request it is best to focus only on what was changed with changes included in this pull request. Sometimes it so happens that the pull requests highlights issues with code decisions that were made in the past. While it might be tempting to give comments on how these old changes should be reworked to better suit current situation, usually that is counter productive. It will only likely drag on the process of getting changes into production and potentially create disdain for interacting with older code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide suggestions for the problems that you raise. It is not that helpful for other engineer when you review the pull request and just state that \"this or that\" is wrong and should be made better. It is best if you provide actionable points on how exactly the code could be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prioritise helping other learn, rather that scold. While there is some inherent friction in the pull request review process, because it is inherently asymmetrical, as a reviewer, try to make it as pleasant as possible for the reviewee. Don't go into blame games or trying to show the \"smart way of doing things\". Provide actionable solutions and focus on getting the code good enough, rather than perfect. Code usually can be infinitely optimised, but if the current code does what it is supposed to do and is sufficiently maintainable - it is probably good enough."

    "[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an open source version control system. Originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Git was created for use in the development of Linux kernel, but quickly spread into other organisations as well. Although Git can be used to version any files, it is typically used by software engineers to version code.\n",

    "Version control systems allow track changes and collaborate working with files. Some of the primary features of VCSs are:\n",
    "- Tracking how file have change over time,\n",
    "- Being able to revert the file state to specific point,\n",
    "- Allowing multiple people to collaborate working on the same file base,\n",
    "- Graciously managing the scenarios when multiple people are trying to make simultaneous changes to same files."

During the 2022 [StackOverflow developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-version-control-version-control-systems) over 93% respondents stated that they use Git as a primary version control system. In comparison the second most popular VCS was [SVN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion) at 5%.\n",

    "Some companies, like Facebook, choose to use non-Git version control systems like Mercurial. More about the Facebook case can be read [here](https://engineering.fb.com/2014/01/07/core-infra/scaling-mercurial-at-facebook/) and [here](https://github.com/facebook/sapling). Some of the factors why companies might choose alternative VCS are enormous scale of their codebases."

    "Most other VCS usually track only the changes to the original files rather than full snapshots. Using this approach the latest file state can be reconstructure by taking the original file and the applying all the changes ever made to that file. This typically does not impact the workflows of how Git is used, but keeping this model in mind, helps to explain some of the aspects of how Git works, i.e. deatched heads, forced changes and so on."

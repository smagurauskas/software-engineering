A well known CA issues a certificate for a website and the client can check with the CA if it really did issue that certificate. This model relies on the notion that there is only a very limited amount of CAs present and unlimited amount of websites available. Operating systems *typically* come bundled with predefined list of CAs that are trusted. HTTPS client can then locally check if the certificate that was provided by the server is is correctly signed by one of the CA.\n",
